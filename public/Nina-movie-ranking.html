<h1>Top 3 best worst movies of all time</h1>
<h2>You'll want to miss these movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3. Birdemic</h3>
<p>Birdemic has everything a bad movie enthusiat wishes in a movie. Bad CGI, horrible dialog, and a really bad allegory about how we are killing the planet and now the birds wants to get back at us for it. I mean, what else do you want in a movie? Maybe something that makes sense? That it feels like someone gave a crap? Not me.</p>
<h3>2. The Room</h3>
<p>When it comes to bad movies, this is the one you should start with. It should've actually be called "Tommy Wiseau: Tommying Wiseauying" 'cause i don't think there is anyone else in this world who can act, write and direct like this misteriously rich man.</p>
<p>What is this movie about? You tell me, your guess is as good as mine. And i've seen in like 5 times.</p>
<h3>1. Who Killed Captain Alex?</h3>
<p>Being serious now, this is one of the most fun i've ever had in a movie. It has all the best aspects of the first two films in this list; The awful CGI, the bad acting, the script that means nothing, and most importantly, the "WHAT THE FUCK AM I WATCHING" element.</p>
</p>
<p>But what makes this movie so special, is the fun that all of the actor are having. The low cost everything has. The feeling among everyone who worked on this of "i just want to make a movie because a i love movies". It reminds me of when i was a kid and just wanted to record some stories with me and my friends, just because is fun. </p>
<p>Sit down with a few friends, grab some drinks (alcohoolic preferably) and watch this masterpiece of a bad movie.</p>
